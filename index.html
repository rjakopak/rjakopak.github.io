        		<h1>Rhiannon Jakopak </h1>
			<br><br>
				<p>My name is Rhiannon Jakopak, and I am an outreach coordinator and research scientist with the Monteith Shop in the Haub School 
					of Environment and Natural Resources at the University of Wyoming. I enjoy thinking about mammal ecology (especially 
					behavior!), how people across stakeholder groups value wildlife, and how to use science to influence law and policy 
					decisions.  

			<br> 
			<br> 

				Both for work and play, I am especially happy when I get to spend time outside. Whether I am  walking around with my eyes 
					glued to the forest floor in search of fresh deer poop or taking my dogs for a long walk around the "city" of 
					Laramie, I love being outside. 

			<br> 
			<br> 


				This deep love of being outside makes me want to share how special outside is with everyone that I can! I took the picture 
					to the left after talking to 3rd graders in the Pacific Northwest through Skype a Scientist! I am fortunate that 
					half--yes, half!-- of my work is devoted to science communication. Right now I am mostly focused on K12 engagement 
					and curriculum development.
